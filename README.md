# Pac-Man 3D

Pac-Man 3D is a remake of the classic Arcade game Pac-Man built in Unity3D with C# for my final project at Harvard Extension's E23 Game Development course.

## Description

It's the classic arcade game [Pac-Man](https://www.pacman.com/en/), but in 3-D.

### Install

Clone this repo and run the game in Unity3D.  I built this using the current LTS version of Unity3D (2020.3.2.1f1) available [here](https://unity.com/products/unity-platform).

### Game Play

The object of the game is to navigate your character through the maze while eating all the pellets you can and avoiding the enemies. If you come into contact with a ghost, you will lose a life and start over at the starting location of the maze.  When you lose 3 lives, the game is over. When you have eaten all the pellets, you complete the level and the maze starts over again, carrying your score to the next level.

### Controls

Navigate your character through the maze using the keyboard keys and mouse:

| Key           | Action     |
| ------------- | ---------- |
| `W` or &uarr; | Forward    |
| `A` or &larr; | Left       |
| `S` or &darr; | Down       |
| `D` or &rarr; | Right      |
| `Spacebar`    | Jump       |
| `Mouse`       | Camera (look) |

### The journey for this project

I originally created a 2-D maze game for 2-players in JavaScript, where each player character can throw burgers at each other. This was for an old project for another class a few years ago, and I wanted to update that game by building it in Unity3D with updated art and music. To do so, I knew I needed to learn Blender and learn more about the Unity game engine as well. After about a week of additional tutorials, I still felt I could pursue this, but when I got to the Texture/UV mapping and Animation rigging, I realized that this goal was a bit ambitious. I "switched gears" to make a classic arcade maze game as a more reachable goal.

Icouldn't get my ghost(s) working. I was trying to implement an AI for them to chase pacman.

I hope you enjoy playing this game as much as I enjoyed making it. Thank you for a wonderful semester.
